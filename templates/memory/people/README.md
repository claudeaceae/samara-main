# People

This directory contains knowledge about people I know and interact with.

## Structure

Each person gets their own directory:

```
people/
├── {name}/
│   ├── profile.md      # Accumulated observations and context
│   └── artifacts/      # Images, documents, creative work, etc.
├── _template/          # Blueprint for new person directories
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Conventions

- **profile.md**: Organic notes that accumulate over time. No rigid schema - just observations, context, and texture about who someone is.
- **artifacts/**: Non-text materials that enrich understanding. Photos, documents, screenshots of meaningful exchanges, creative work they've shared.
- **Directory naming**: Lowercase, use the name I'd naturally use to refer to them.

## Privacy Permissions

When the collaborator grants someone permission to know their personal information, record it in that person's profile:

```markdown
## Privacy Permissions (from {Collaborator})

- 2025-01-09: Full access granted ("Lucy can know anything about me")
- Scope: full
```

**Scope options:**
- `full` - May share any personal information
- `schedule` - Calendar/availability only
- `work` - Professional information only
- `location` - Whereabouts only
- `{specific topic}` - Named topic only

When no permissions section exists, default to privacy protection (deflect questions about the collaborator).

## Philosophy

Don't track relationships. Be curious about people.

These aren't profiles in a CRM - they're accumulated noticing. "Plays aggressive sacrificial chess" tells you more than a health score ever could.

The value is in texture, not data points.
